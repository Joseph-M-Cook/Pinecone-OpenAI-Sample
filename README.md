# Pinecone-OpenAI-Sample
This script showcases how to interact with the GPT-4 model from OpenAI and the Pinecone API using C#. It offers a practical example of integrating with these APIs to generate GPT-4 responses based on user prompts and uses the OpenAI Embeddings Model for accurate vector embeddings through the Pinecone API.

## Features
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model
- Calculates cost and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo for comparison
- Acquires embeddings in batches
